Programming Project 1, PythonPrompt: A cookie recipe calls for the following ingredients:* 1.5 cups of sugar* 1 cup of butter* 2.75 cups of flourThe recipe produces 48 cookies with this amount of ingredients. Write a program that asks the user how many cookies they want to make and then displays the number of cups of each ingredient needed for the specified number of cookies.When the program asks the user for the number of cookies, it should display the following string as a prompt:'Enter number of cookies:'When the program displays the number of cups of ingredients, it should display a message in the following format:You need xcups of sugar, ycups of butter, and zcups of flour.Where xis the number of cups of sugar, yis the number of cups of butter, and zis the number of cups of flour. Don’t worry about rounding the numbers in the output.Solution: cookies = input('Enter number of cookies:')c = (int(cookies))x = (c / 48) * 1.5y = (c / 48) * 1.0z = (c / 48) * 2.75print("You need " + str(x) + " cups of sugar, " + str(y) + " cups of butter," " and " + str(z) + " cups of flour.")
